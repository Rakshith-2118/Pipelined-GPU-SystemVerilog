# Pipelined-GPU-SystemVerilog
This project is a complete, from-scratch design and implementation of a 4-stage, dual-core pipelined Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in SystemVerilog. It is built on a custom Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) architecture designed for high-throughput parallel computation.
